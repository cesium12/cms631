Motivation

Computers are everywhere.  In our pockets.  On our desks.  In our
laps.  But few people actually know what's going on in a
computer. It's a bit of a mystical thing: you press the on button, and
then you can do anything.  But how are these things possible?
Programs have to be able to interact with a user, but all of the
computers out there are different.  Not to mention programs have to
talk to other programs as well, to make the Internet work.  How do all
of these things happen?  Why is the brand-new computer you just bought
feel as slow as the old one under your desk?

As computers have gotten faster, the interactions between programs
have increased.  So once-simple tasks are actually quite complex.
What a tangled web.


Kernel
------

For a computer to be useful, there has to be a program that managed
all of the hardware resources.  This program is traditionally called
the "kernel".  Any program that needs to talk to another program, or
use the computer hardware, must make a request to the kernel.
Depending on what the program needs, different parts of the kernel
will service the request.  These different parts are called "modules".

Xorg
----

The graphics system is called Xorg, and has its roots from the MIT X
Window System project.  Xorg is responsible for performing the actual
drawing-on-the-screen for graphical programs.

Chrome
------

Chrome is a popular internet browser built by Google.  Chrome needs to
talk to the internet to download web pages, as well the graphics
system to display content and react to user actions, like typing and
mouse clicks.  Chrome also runs multiple copies of itself, one per web
page, to prevent the whole thing from crashing if something goes
wrong.  That means Chrome also needs to talk other Chrome processes.

Gnome Shell
-----------

Gnome is a Desktop Environment, providing the ability to launch
programs from the familiar menu, as well as switching between
graphical applications.  The Shell is the program that provides these
features, such as drawing the background image and fancy transition
effects when you minimize/maximize a program.

Gnome Terminal
--------------

The Terminal is a program that allows the user to issue commands in a
text-based client, similar to how users interacted with computers
before graphical user interfaces existed at all.

RhythmBox
---------

RhythmBox is Gnome's music player.
