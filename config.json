It's a bit of a mystical thing: you press the on button, and\nthen you can do anything.  But how are these things possible?\nPrograms have to be able to interact with a user, but all of the\ncomputers out there are different.  Not to mention programs have to\ntalk to other programs as well, to make the Internet work.  How do all\nof these things happen?  Why is the brand-new computer you just bought\nfeel as slow as the old one under your desk?\nAs computers have gotten faster, the interactions between programs\nhave increased.  So once-simple tasks are actually quite complex.\nWhat a tangled web.",

Chrome needs to\ntalk to the internet to download web pages, as well the graphics\nsystem to display content and react to user actions, like typing and\nmouse clicks.  Chrome also runs multiple copies of itself, one per web\npage, to prevent the whole thing from crashing if something goes\nwrong.  That means Chrome also needs to talk other Chrome processes."
